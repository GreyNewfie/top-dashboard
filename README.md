This project is THe Odin Project Dashboard. This project primary focus to help me to 
practice using CSS Grid. I want to continue practicing making responsive layouts with 
more complicated design. 
This project will use HTML and CSS, and while my main goal is to focus on practice using
grid, I will use flexbox if and when I feel it's better suited.
